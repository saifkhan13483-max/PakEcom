Create deployment documentation with step-by-step platform-specific instructions and verify deployed site functionality including routing, images, forms, and all interactive features.

Implementation Notes:
Sequential Approach: Follow parts in order as later components depend on earlier implementations. Each phase builds upon previous work creating a cohesive application.

Testing Strategy: After every 3-4 parts, conduct thorough testing of implemented functionality to prevent cascading issues and facilitate easier debugging.

Pakistani Market Focus: Maintain consistent focus on Pakistani requirements including PKR currency formatting with thousand separators, phone number validation (Pakistani formats), city selection (major Pakistani cities), payment methods (COD priority, bank transfer, mobile wallets), and cultural preferences (trust indicators, WhatsApp integration).

Frontend-Only Architecture: All implementations designed for frontend-only application with no backend server. Use localStorage for guest persistence and Firebase/Firestore client-side SDK for authenticated users. All functionality is client-side with mock data and simulated API calls.

Modern React Patterns: Leverage React 18 features, strict TypeScript configuration, and modern patterns throughout. Use Vite's fast HMR during development and optimized production builds.

Accessibility First: Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

Performance Focused: Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions with code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and efficient state management using Zustand.
